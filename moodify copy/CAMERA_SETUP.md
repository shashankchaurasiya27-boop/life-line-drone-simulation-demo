# Camera Setup for Moodify

## Camera Integration Fix

The camera integration in the Moodify application has been fixed. Here are the key improvements made:

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing variable declaration** - Fixed the `tracks` variable in the `stopWebcam` function
2. **Interval management** - Properly managed the analysis interval with useRef
3. **Error handling** - Added comprehensive error handling for camera access
4. **HTTPS requirements** - Added checks for HTTPS/localhost requirements
5. **Cleanup** - Added proper cleanup in useEffect

### Requirements for Camera Access:

1. **HTTPS or Localhost**: Camera access requires HTTPS in production or localhost for development
2. **Modern Browser**: Use a modern browser that supports `getUserMedia` API
3. **Camera Permissions**: Grant camera permissions when prompted

### How to Test:

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application via:
   - `http://localhost:4028` (for development)
   - `https://your-domain.com` (for production)

4. Navigate to the Real-Time Emotion Dashboard
5. Click the "Start" button in the Live Emotion Detection widget
6. Grant camera permissions when prompted
7. The camera feed should now appear and emotion analysis should begin

### Troubleshooting:

- **"Camera access is not supported"**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **"Camera access requires HTTPS"**: Access the app via HTTPS or localhost
- **Permission denied**: Check browser settings and grant camera permissions
- **No video feed**: Ensure camera is not being used by another application

### Development Notes:

- The camera integration uses the `getUserMedia` API
- Video constraints are set to 640x480 with front-facing camera
- Emotion analysis is currently simulated with random emotions
- The component properly cleans up resources when unmounted
